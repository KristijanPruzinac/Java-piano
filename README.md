Use "Interactive key capture" to record keys on pinao on site https://virtualpiano.net

- By pressing "shift" a key will be captured

Use "Move chord" to move the whole song ("Notes.txt") by how much notes you want higher or lower - is lower, + is higher example   3 <-- move all notes 3 higher

Put libraries into your eclipse project and add to build path

Copy and paste code from "code.txt" into your main class

Copy and paste instructions from "Compiled_notes.txt" or "Notes.txt" if you didnt want to change chords and replace line 83 with instructions
